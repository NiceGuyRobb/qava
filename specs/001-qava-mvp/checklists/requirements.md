- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 passed all checks on 2026-07-25.
- Product-level interchange formats (JSON Schema and canonical JSON) are retained as observable MVP contract requirements, not implementation choices.
- Coverage includes 38 unique functional requirements, 14 unique success criteria, 24 acceptance scenarios, explicit edge cases, MVP exclusions, dependencies, and assumptions.
- No clarification markers or unresolved template placeholders remain.
